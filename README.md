**CAMPUS LOST AND FOUND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**

The Lost and Found Management System is a database-driven application designed to help manage and track misplaced or recovered items within a campus, office, or public institution. 
Traditional manual systems are time-consuming and error prone, making it difficult to match lost items with those found. 
This system automates the process by allowing users to report lost or found items, categorize them, and match records based on attributes such as item name, description, or location. The 
system uses MySQL for data storage, stored procedures and triggers for logic enforcement, and a Streamlit web interface for easy interaction.

The main problem addressed by this project is the inefficiency in handling lost and found items manually. 
Often, records are incomplete, mismanaged, or inaccessible, making it hard to return items to their owners. 
This project aims to design and implement a digital system that: 
1. Stores details of lost and found items systematically. 
2. Allows users to report and track items easily. 
3. Ensures automatic updates in item status through 
database triggers. 
4. Provides reports and analytics through SQL queries 
and functions.
